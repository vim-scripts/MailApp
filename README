This plugin allows Mac OS X users to send e-mails from Vim using the Mail.app application.

It provides syntax highlighting, auto-completion for header name, e-mail and attachment.

To start a new e-mail, use the command :NewMailApp, which will open a new buffer where you can start writing. To send the e-mail, use the command :SendMailApp.
